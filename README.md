# (WIP) CourseWork for **WebSearch&Mining** 

## (Currently) A Basic Boolean Information Retrieval Model : 
### A Simple Application to Handle Boolean Queries on Documents 

This project is the implementaion of all the course-work done for Web Search and Mining course.

### Current Work : 
 
 - Assignment 1 : 
    -  

### Points to be kept in mind
 - Web based interface 
    - A search bar
    - Results rendered beneath the search bar 
    - A timing function to estimate retirval time
    - How to make the document change dynamic? 
    - made using node, python c++ to handle the message passing?

 - CLI based program ?
    - grep-like program?
    - path to the containing folder can be given, so any set of documents can be taken 
    - Python based GUI ?
    - combines features of both
    - c++ code can be run to make indexing faster

 - Running the document delineator in Python and then running the indexer in C++.
    - export the inverted index for later uses? 
    - Quering should be done in C++ too?
